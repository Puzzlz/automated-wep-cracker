  abstract = 	"In this article we present some weaknesses in the RC4 cipher and their cryptographic applications. Especially we improve the attack described by Fluhrer, Mantin, Shamir (In: Selected Areas in Cryptography, 2001) in such a way, that it will work, if the weak keys described in that paper are avoided. A further attack will work even if the first 256 Byte of the output remain unused. Finally we show that variants of the RC4 algorithm like NGG and RC4A are also vulnerable by these techniques.",

  abstract = 	"We demonstrate an active attack on the WEP protocol that is able to recover a 104-bit WEP key using less than 40,000 frames with a success probability of 50{\%}. In order to succeed in 95{\%} of all cases, 85,000 packets are needed. The IV of these packets can be randomly chosen. This is an improvement in the number of required frames by more than an order of magnitude over the best known key-recovery attacks for WEP. On a IEEE 802.11g network, the number of frames required can be obtained by re-injection in less than a minute. The required computational effort is approximately 220 RC4 key setups, which on current desktop and laptop CPUs is negligible.",
